# AI-Research-Canvas-Application
The AI Canvas is a visual research interface powered by an AI API for deepseek. 

It allows users to explore and organize research topics in an interactive, draggable canvas. 

You can save a research project and share it with others, they just have to be on the site and load the file you send to them.

Can be used to investigate and map out relationships between concepts. An example is located here : https://ezlogik.com/ai-canvas/
